# MongoDB $inc Operator Error: Incorrect Usage and Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB update queries.  The `$inc` operator is intended to increment a numeric field by a specified value.  However, misuse, such as attempting to increment a non-existent or non-numeric field, can lead to errors or unexpected behavior. This example showcases this issue and provides a correct solution.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file contains code that attempts to increment a field that does not exist or is not numeric. This results in errors or unpredictable changes in your documents.  Understanding and handling these errors is crucial for robust MongoDB applications.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected approach.  It checks the existence and type of the field before applying the `$inc` operation, preventing common errors associated with the operator.  It utilizes additional MongoDB operators to ensure correct handling of different scenarios.
